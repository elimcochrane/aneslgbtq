This repository analyses the questions in the 2024 ANES time series that are related to LGBTQ+ communities. 

**Data analysis was done in line with the recommended methods:**
DeBell, Matthew. 2010. How to Analyze ANES Survey Data. ANES Technical Report Series no. nes012492. Palo Alto, CA, and Ann Arbor, MI: Stanford University and the University of Michigan.

**The data and codebook I used can be found here:**
https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2024-time-series-study/

Currently, this analysis creates simple bar graphs to visualize the occurrance (in percentages) of each response to each question.
